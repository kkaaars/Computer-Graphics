## Folder Details

### **lab_1** - Color Model Transformations
This folder focuses on converting between different color models (e.g., RGB to HSL). The lab demonstrates the application of color model transformations in image processing.

---

### **lab_2** - Image Manipulation and Processing
In this folder, algorithms for image compressing and processing are implemented. Key operations include JPEG compressing, adaptive thresholding, and other basic image processing.

---

### **lab_3** - Basic raster algorithms
This folder implements several raster algorithms. Examples include:
- Step by Step
- Bresenham's algorithm
- DDA-algorithm
- Bresenham's algorithm for circle
- Smoothing algorithm
